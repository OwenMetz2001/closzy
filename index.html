      <p>In a world where danger lies in the dim-lit alleyways, the empty parking lots, and even our warm homes, we believe that everyone deserves to move freely without fear, because only then one will be able to actually live to their fullest.

      <p>Closzy was established by and for women, to help our own out. To be a guiding hand through the scary dark streets, to bring light and warmth and safety back into your homes, back into your lives.
