      <p>In a world where danger lies in the dim-lit alleyways, the empty parking lots, and even our warm homes, we believe that everyone deserves to move freely without fear, because only then one will be able to actually live to their fullest. Closzy was established for those who suffer feelings of insecurity. For those who are scared to walk alone at night, or even during the day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>Closzy was established by and for women, to help our own out. To be a guiding hand through the scary dark streets, to bring light and warmth and safety back into your homes, back into your lives. Join us on our journey to a world with the same level of comfort of the blanket forts you used to build as a kid.</p>
